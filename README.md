# github-drama (community fork #2)

This is a curated collection of "dramatic" GitHub interactions.

## Contributing to github-drama

This repo is intended to point out controversial situations that come up in the world of software development, and not to harass anyone. Sometimes tensions build up in
online interactions, and the intention of github-drama is to preserve links to such discussions so people can discover and read them.

### Phylogenetic tree

This repository is [neodrama/github-drama](https://github.com/neodrama/github-drama). It was forked from [github-drama/github-drama](https://github.com/github-drama/github-drama) repository in August 2023, when github-drama organisation was [made private due to someone's report](https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama/issues/156#issuecomment-1671123019). The github-drama/github-drama repository was forked in 2022 from [nikolas/github-drama](https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama). 

### How do I find drama?

Go into a GitHub project's issues, and sort by "Most commented" or "Most reactions".

### What qualifies as drama?

There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included in github-drama. There are plenty of "non-serious" GitHub threads, where the usual GitHub politeness 
gives way to reaction GIFs and one-word replies, turning into something like a 4chan thread, but less funny. Common signs of drama: many unconstructive comments, many downvote 
reactions, removed or hidden comments. If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also a good indicator that it could be included here.

  * Kubernetes users install ad blockers in their development environment to suppress the nagware.
  * The community then creates new ad-free forks and Docker images.

* Summary:
  * Without first consulting the qBittorrent developers privately,
    an alt account publicly disclosed a path traversal vulnerability
    by opening a GitHub issue in February 2023.
    (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, CVD, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure))
  * One GitHub user responded,
    "That doesn't respect my freedom™ to use a better client."
    Many reacted to the reply with a thumbs-down emoji.
    ([Source](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/18618#issuecomment-1445493562))
  * Another GitHub user commented,
    "What is your problem with using civilized language?"
    A qBittorrent maintainer marked the comment as abuse.

* Summary:
  * Google is prototyping a browser fingerprinting API that detects the browser's build, extensions, and overall environment around it.
  * This API allows for websites to collectively exclude all browsers and users that do not use any browser, extension, or OS approved (attested) by Google themselves, essentially forcing all browser developers to register their web browser to Google for testing, and disallowing most Chromium forks.
