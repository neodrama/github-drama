* Summary:
  * Without first consulting the qBittorrent developers privately,
    an alt account publicly disclosed a path traversal vulnerability
    by opening a GitHub issue in February 2023.
    (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, CVD, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure))
  * One GitHub user responded,
    "That doesn't respect my freedom™ to use a better client."
    Many reacted to the reply with a thumbs-down emoji.
    ([Source](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/18618#issuecomment-1445493562))
  * Another GitHub user commented,
    "What is your problem with using civilized language?"
    A qBittorrent maintainer marked the comment as abuse.

* Summary:
  * Google is prototyping a browser fingerprinting API that detects the browser's build, extensions, and overall environment around it.
  * This API allows for websites to collectively exclude all browsers and users that do not use any browser, extension, or OS approved (attested) by Google themselves, essentially forcing all browser developers to register their web browser to Google for testing, and disallowing most Chromium forks.
