# Contributing to github-drama

## What qualifies as drama?

There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included in github-drama. There are plenty of "non-serious" GitHub threads, where the usual GitHub politeness 
gives way to reaction GIFs and one-word replies, turning into something like a 4chan thread, but less funny. Common signs of drama: many unconstructive comments, many downvote 
reactions, removed or hidden comments. If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also a good indicator that it could be included here.

## How do I find drama?

Go into a GitHub project's issues, and sort by "Most commented" or "Most reactions".

## Adding new drama

A new drama entry should follow the standardized formatting style used in the main README. There are two main formats:

**Short entry:**

```
- [user/repo/issues/1](https://github.com/user/repo/issues/1)
```

**Extended entry:**

```
### owner/repo

- [owner/repo/issues/123](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123) (archive: [1](https://archive.ph/abcde), [2](https://archive.ph/abcde), [3](https://archive.ph/abcde))
  - Brief summary of the drama, written in a neutral tone.
  - Additional context or summary lines as needed.
  - Journalistic Media:
    - [Media Outlet Title](https://media.example.com/article) (archive: [1](https://archive.ph/xyz), [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000000/https://media.example.com/article))
```

**Formatting guidelines:**
- Use `### owner/repo` as the section heading.
- List all relevant GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions as bullet points, with archive links in the format `(archive: [1](...), [2](...), [3](...))` if available.
- Place the summary and context below the links, not above.
- If there are journalistic or media articles, add a `Journalistic Media:` section with links and archives at the bottom.
- Write summaries in a neutral, factual style, avoiding personal opinions or advocacy.
- Replace political or sensitive subjects with: ***⚠️ Sensitive Topic***
