# Contributing to github-drama

## What qualifies as drama?

There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included in github-drama. There are plenty of "non-serious" GitHub threads, where the usual GitHub politeness 
gives way to reaction GIFs and one-word replies, turning into something like a 4chan thread, but less funny. Common signs of drama: many unconstructive comments, many downvote 
reactions, removed or hidden comments. If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also a good indicator that it could be included here.

## How do I find drama?

Go into a GitHub project's issues, and sort by "Most commented" or "Most reactions".

## Adding new drama

A new drama entry should follow the standardized formatting style used in the main README. There are two main formats:

**Short entry:**

```
- [user/repo/issues/1](https://github.com/user/repo/issues/1)
```

**Extended entry:**

```
### owner/repo

- [owner/repo/issues/123](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123) (archive: [1](https://archive.ph/abcde), [2](https://archive.ph/abcde), [3](https://archive.ph/abcde))
  - Brief summary of the drama, written in a neutral tone.
  - Additional context or summary lines as needed.
  - Journalistic Media:
    - [Media Outlet Title](https://media.example.com/article) (archive: [1](https://archive.ph/xyz), [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000000/https://media.example.com/article))
```

**Formatting guidelines:**
- Use `### owner/repo` as the section heading.
- List all relevant GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions as bullet points, with archive links in the format `(archive: [1](...), [2](...), [3](...))` if available.
- Place the summary and context below the links, not above.
- If there are journalistic or media articles, add a `Journalistic Media:` section with links and archives at the bottom.
- Write summaries in a neutral, factual style, avoiding personal opinions or advocacy.
- Replace political or sensitive subjects with: ***⚠️ Sensitive Topic***

- If there are non-github links that describe the drama, consider adding them. High priority external links to add are articles in popular journalistic media.

 - Adding drama summary is not mandatory. In the simplest case the entry can just consist of the single link to the dramatic thread. Summary can be helpful when there are multiple links that need to be logically grouped to better understand the drama.

 - When drama summary is added, it must be as neutral as possible. Describe facts and events, but **do not** assess drama participants' actions, advocate for any political/ideological views, or use a negative speech. When in doubt, leave out any details and make summary as short as possible.
